        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The faculty of Engineering and Information Technology (FEIT) is a faculty within the Southern University College (Southern UC). 
          It was established on August 12, 2012 after Southern College (SC) was upgraded to Southern UC. 
          The history reaches back to two decades ago, when the Department of Computer Science was first established in 1991, 
          followed by the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering in 2004. These two departments were then integrated and 
          renamed as the School of Engineering and Information Technology (SEIT) in March 2006. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Nestled in the intricate beauty of lush greeneries and foliage, the faculty is on the second floor of Southern
          UC’s main building. Currently, the faculty has 40% of the teaching staff who are Ph.D holders specializing in
          different fields of studies.

              <h3 class="courseName">Diploma in Information Technology</h3>
              <p>Based on the information technology, business organization and industrial needs, the curriculums are designed to provide the student 
                with the techniques and knowledge in the applications and process of Information technology,
                as well as to train the students to be excellent at organisational needs analysis and information. 
                With both computer and business organization knowledge so that they will be able to enter into 
                the employment market with the advantages of strong technical skills.

              <h3 class="courseName">Diploma in Computer Science</h3>
              <p>The course not only emphasises on the academic theories and the practical applications, 
                but it also takes into considerations of the career prospect and future development of the students. 
                Therefore, it covers most of the aspects of Computer Science and mainly focuses on system analysis, 
                programming and system development.

              <p>The course will be delivered pedagogically to students by combining concepts, latest information, 
                feasible methods and scientific ways. In doing so, students will learn the essence of software 
                engineering, including the related fields of programming language, system analysis, 
                software design and quality management. Related knowledge will be imparted  professionally 
                to students through basic theory, practical projects, and industrial training to enhance students’ 
                analytical, programming and software design skills.

                Founded in 2004, we have established a reputation in teaching electronics engineering courses to 
                diploma and degree students in Southern region of Malaysia. The department has produced graduates 
                that meet the needs of the country. In order for doing so, we have carefully designed and reviewed 
                from time to time the course curriculums to meet the quality set by Engineering Technology 
                Accreditation Council (ETAC) and Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA).

                This course is designed for those who wish to broaden their knowledge in 
                electronics engineering. It's main objectives are to train students in the 
                aspects of analysis and design, practical and project handling and problem 
                solving skills. In doing so, we hope our graduates will be equipped with a solid 
                foundation upon joining employment and with the necessary skills to meet the challenges 
                in the fields of engineering today.
